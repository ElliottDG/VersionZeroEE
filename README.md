Easter Egg code put together for the Version Zero book javascript code blocks

Some modifications made for cross-platform (windows/linux) and funny time zones.

Solution printout in Solution.png and some answers left as comments in the VS.js javascript file :)

If you wish to run yourself, any js interpreter should work or sandbox env :) I used https://playcode.io/empty_javascript . Just paste in and solution should print.
